## Dragon Maze
A Java-based maze game I created for my introduction to computer science course where the player must escape a labyrinth while avoiding a dragon. This project demonstrates concepts in object-oriented programming, user input handling, and basic pathfinding or game logic.

## Project Structure
Project2.java: Main class to run the game. Handles user interaction and game loop.
DragonMaze.java: Contains the maze logic, grid generation, and dragon/player mechanics.

## How to Play
Navigate through the maze using W/A/S/D.
Save the princess by navigating to her location in the maze.
Once you have the princess, avoid the dragon and try to reach the goal.

## Concepts Used
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2D arrays and maze logic
Java console I/O
